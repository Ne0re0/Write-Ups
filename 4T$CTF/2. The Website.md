# Description

```
It should be pretty simple to know what to do from here on out.

Find out as much information as you can, there must be something... right?

The flag follows the format: 4T${<hex_key>}. The flag for this challenge will be annotated P2.

**Communications**
![](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241111110933.png)
This page contains 4 PGP encrypted messages

`Communication is the key` is an hint to tell us to find a way to decrypt the communication.
`Change password of gpg key` is an hint to tell us `owen.perkins` reuses his passwords


**Access terminal**
![](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241111111257.png)

We are provided with a very cool terminal that enables us to run commands such as `cd`, `ls` and `cat`

The first thing that popped to my eyes is the `.gnupg` folder which contains GPG privates keys

To make things easier, I made a script to extract files and extracted all files in `.gnupg`
```python
import requests
import base64
import json
import os

while True :
    cmd = input("> ")
    url = "https://hackcorp.net:443/api/v1/terminal?command=" + cmd
    cookies = {
	    "session": "MTczMTA5OTcyOHxEWDhFQVFMX2dBQUJFQUVRQUFCQV80QUFBUVp6ZEhKcGJtY01CQUFDYVdRR2MzUnlhVzVuRENZQUpESTNabVU1WWpVNUxUZGxOell0TkdWaFlTMDVZVEl3TFRoaVlUWmpNemt6Wm1Sa01nPT18lzqbBLJ7rRGp57pikXl4QSrhJ8Xqssy6ruyL5AZUg5Q="
    }
    headers = {
	    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0", 
	    "Accept": "*/*", 
	    "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.5", 
	    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate, br", 
	    "Referer": "https://hackcorp.net/restricted/terminal", 
	    "Sec-Fetch-Dest": "empty", "Sec-Fetch-Mode": "cors", 
	    "Sec-Fetch-Site": 
	    "same-origin", 
	    "Priority": "u=0", 
	    "Te": "trailers"
	}

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, cookies=cookies)

    res = json.loads(response.text)
    
    try :
        content = base64.b64decode(res['message']).decode()
        print(content)
    except : 
        pass

    if cmd.split(" ")[0] == "cat" :
        with open(cmd.split(" ")[1],'wb') as f : 
            f.write(base64.b64decode(res['message']))
    if cmd.split(" ")[0] == "cd" :
        print(cmd.split(" ")[1])
        os.system("mkdir " + cmd.split(" ")[1] + " -p")
        os.chdir(cmd.split(" ")[1])
```

I copied the `.gnupg` folder to `~/.gnupg` and I extracted all messages from the `Communications` channel and wrote them to `message1-4`

```bash
gpg --decrypt message1 # A password is asked, I just enter the only password i knew and BOOM
gpg --decrypt message2
gpg --decrypt message3
gpg --decrypt message4
```

*Note that message 1 and 2 do not contain relevant infos and message 4 is only relevant for step 4,5 and 6*

**Message 3**
```
gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID 7609D328E170A7B3, created 2024-11-02
      "Owen Perkins <owen.perkins@hackcorp.net>"
Hey Owen, this is Loreta.

I'm writing you this on the central system so that noone can catch it.
I've seen the information you wanted me to see in that file.
May we meet soon.

PS: Why did you have to XOR it that way ? It took me quite some time to figure this out...

PPS: What was that about Wawa, Inc. ? Was it us who did this, I mean, who are we really working for ?

- Loreta
```

**Message 4**
- Note that this message was not present in the first wave of the CTF. 
- It contains an hint for the steps 4,5 and 6 but when I solved step 2, it was not available
```
gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID 7609D328E170A7B3, created 2024-11-02
      "Owen Perkins <owen.perkins@hackcorp.net>"
Hey Owen,

Listen, I know you owe me nothing.
However I still need your help,
I've sent you a file, can you tell me what's wrong with my computer ?

PS: The file dates from a while back, I just hadn't had time to send it to you before.

Sincerely yours, Agent X.
```

**So, message 3 is the relevant message** 
- It talks about a file dealing about something called `Wawa`.

So, back to our terminal,
I extracted all files available and one PDF called was talking about `Wawa Incorporation CyberAttack` : `USCOURTS-paed-2_19-cv-06019-4.pdf`

A quick google research and I found the original PDF provided by www.govinfo.gov
- https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-paed-2_19-cv-06019/pdf/USCOURTS-paed-2_19-cv-06019-4.pdf

A download it and made a checksum of both files
```bash
└─$ md5sum USCOURTS-paed-2_19-cv-06019-4.pdf          
6dd61b467ef6a74d58625337be0c0186  USCOURTS-paed-2_19-cv-06019-4.pdf

└─$ md5sum original-USCOURTS-paed-2_19-cv-06019-4.pdf         
05b27dfe74abcce8b24177be34cdaadf  original-USCOURTS-paed-2_19-cv-06019-4.pdf
```
The file we retrieved from `hackcorp.net` has been modified

```bash
└─$ ls -lah *USCOURTS-paed-2_19-cv-06019-4.pdf
-rw-rw-r-- 1 kali kali 1.1M Nov 11 11:31 USCOURTS-paed-2_19-cv-06019-4.pdf
-rw-rw-r-- 1 kali kali 259K Nov 11 11:31 original-USCOURTS-paed-2_19-cv-06019-4.pdf
```

The `hackcorp.net` PDF huuuuuger compared to the original one

Running `strings`, I discovered that data where hidden in it
```
<< 
/Contents  
	[ 20 98 119 114 28 3 29
	... HUUUGE DATA I Can't put all here
	...
	...  119 56 ] 
 /MediaBox [ 0 0 612 792 ] 
 /Parent 110 0 R 
 /Resources << >> 
 /Type /Page 
 >>
```

Extract the data with
```bash
strings corrupted.pdf | grep '20 98 119' | cut -d "[" -f 2 | cut -d "]" -f 1 > extracted_digits
```

And then I used a python script to convert those digits to a real file
```python
with open("extracted_digits") as f :
    content = f.read()
    digits = content.split(" ")

with open("extracted_file","wb") as f :
    for digit in digits :
        try :
            byte = bytes.fromhex(hex(int(digit))[2:])
            f.write(byte)
        except :
            pass # probably an empty string
```

Now that we have extracted the file, we know that the file has been xored.
I sent it to : https://wiremask.eu/tools/xor-cracker/
Which helps me find that the key is `1234` but the extracted file is not valid because of a mishandling of the app I think

But no worry, I made a python script (YES AGAIN !)
```python
with open("extracted_file","rb") as f :
    content = f.read()
    
def simplexor(data, key):
    return bytearray((
        (data[i] ^ key[i % len(key)]) for i in range(0, len(data))
    ))
    
with open("output.pdf","wb") as f :
    f.write(simplexor(content,[ord("1"),ord("2"),ord('3'),ord('4')])) # Xor with 1234 key
```

Here is the unxored file
