# Write-Up

**Date**
 The date was quite easy to find, the first paragraph talks about 14 and novembre so I guessed that was 14th of november 2024

**Time**
The poem references the start of the second nautical twilight
Which sadly can depend on the website you're looking at.. it was around 16:42

**Location**
The second line of the third paragraph talks about the `third lens` which I understand to be the third camera.

With a reverse image search I found it was exactly here

I just had to pick on the `/meeting` with the right date and time and BOOM

```json
	{
	"message":"meeting found",
	 "messages":[
		 "Hello, #######. I've been waiting for you.",
		 "Please come alone and bring the package.",
		 "Don't bring anybody with you.",
		 "Be sure to come at the right time.",
		 "See you soon.",
		 "P3: 4T${fe236be870426b57e398dc8b5587d221}"
	],"status":"ok"
}
```

# Flag

`4T${fe236be870426b57e398dc8b5587d221}`

# Next

Informations found in this step was not linked to any other step.
So, in my solve order, the next step was
