# Description

```
Your friend contacted you to help him with a... "problem".

He found something curious when doing he's daily hacking routine.

But in order to help him, you're going to need to understand what he found.

The flag follows the format: 4T${<hex_key>}. The flag for this challenge will be annotated P1.

# Write-Up

When we look at the pcapng, we can see thousands of packets `URB_ISOCHRONOUS_IN` and `URB_ISOCHRONOUS_OUT` like the following ones

When you are using an USB keyboard, this is the data sent by the keyboard.
Keyboard don't send letters but something called `keystrokes` which is basically an hex number that can be converted to the corresponding letter (depending on the keyboard layout).

Using Hacktricks and `Hall-Effect` challenge from BuckeyeCTF, I filtered the keystrokes in Wireshark
- https://book.hacktricks.xyz/generic-methodologies-and-resources/basic-forensic-methodology/pcap-inspection/usb-keystrokes
- https://ctftime.org/writeup/39503

```sql
usb.transfer_type == 0x01 -- Filter USB keystrokes 
frame.len == 35           -- Filter USB Keystrokes from 2.5.1 to "host"
usb.transfer_type == 0x01 && frame.len == 35 -- final filter
```

I then added HID Data has a column because it make it easier to extract key strokes :
- Right click on a packet
- Right click on `HID Data`
- Select `Apply as a column`

I am now with something like that that I can extract

- File -> Export Packet dissection -> Export as CSV

Extract keystrokes only
```bash
cat keystrokes.csv | cut -d "\"" -f 16 > hexdata.hex
```

Based on that, I made a Python script to convert Keystrokes to the corresponding chars (expecting a QWERTY keyboard layout)
```python
KEY_CODES = {
    0x04: ["a", "A"],
    0x05: ["b", "B"],
    0x06: ["c", "C"],

}

with open('hexdata.hex') as f :
    keystrokes = f.readlines()

# Have to take one keystroke out of 2, don't ask me why, I don't know
keystrokes = [keystrokes[k] for k in range(0,len(keystrokes),2)]

capslock = False # Handle capslock
k = 0
for keystroke in keystrokes :
	bytesArray = bytearray.fromhex(keystroke.strip())
	for byte in bytesArray:
