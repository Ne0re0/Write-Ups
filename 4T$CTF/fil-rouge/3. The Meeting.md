# Write-Up

**Date**
 The date was quite easy to find, the first stanza talks about `fourteen` and `novembre` so I guessed that was 14th of november 2024

**Time**
The poem references the start of the second nautical twilight
Which sadly can depend on the website you're looking at.. it was around 16:42

**Location**
The second verse of the third stanza talks about the `third lens` which I understood to be the third camera.

**Let's do some Geoint**
With a reverse image search I found it was exactly here

I just had to pick on the `/meeting` with the right date and time and BOOM

```json
{
	"message":"meeting found",
	 "messages":[
		 "Hello, #######. I've been waiting for you.",
		 "Please come alone and bring the package.",
		 "Don't bring anybody with you.",
		 "Be sure to come at the right time.",
		 "See you soon.",
		 "P3: 4T${fe236be870426b57e398dc8b5587d221}"
	],
	"status":"ok"
}
```

# Flag

`4T${fe236be870426b57e398dc8b5587d221}`

# Next
