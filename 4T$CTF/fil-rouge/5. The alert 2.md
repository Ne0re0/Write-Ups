# Infos from previous step

**Message 4 from step 2**
```
Hey Owen,

Listen, I know you owe me nothing.
However I still need your help,
I've sent you a file, can you tell me what's wrong with my computer ?

PS: The file dates from a while back, I just hadn't had time to send it to you before.

Sincerely yours, Agent X.
```

# Write Up

Based on the message above message, and the fact that step 5 came from the second wave, I went back to the terminal and I found a `dump` file that wasn't here before the second wave was uploaded.

So, I took back my script from step 2 and extracted the file.

As every forensic player, I run a `string` against that memory dump
```
└─$ strings dump | grep '4T\${'
	flag := "4T${09239d77fff8b6cad3f63ed88cd7b855}"
```

# Flag

`4T${09239d77fff8b6cad3f63ed88cd7b855}`

# Next
